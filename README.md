## Running the app

  npm start
  ```

- Build and run iOS and Android development builds:

  ```sh
  npm run ios

  npm run android
  ```

- In the terminal running the development server, press `i` to open the iOS simulator, `a` to open the Android device or emulator, or `w` to open the web browser.

## Notes

This project uses a [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/) and cannot be run with [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go). To run the app with Expo Go, edit the `package.json` file, remove the `expo-dev-client` package and `--dev-client` flag from the `start` script. However, Edge-to-edge won't work on Expo Go.

We highly recommend using the development builds for normal development and testing.

The `ios` and `android` folder are gitignored in the project by default as they are automatically generated during the build process ([Continuous Native Generation](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/)). This means that you should not edit these folders directly and use [config plugins](https://docs.expo.dev/config-plugins/) instead. However, if you need to edit these folders, you can remove them from the `.gitignore` file so that they are tracked by git.
